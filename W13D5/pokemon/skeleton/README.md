# **Pokedex (Part 1)**

&nbsp;

<kbd>Pokedex: Part 1 - Jbuilder, React, Redux</kbd>

Okay, now it is time to put everything you know to its ultimate use and build the coolest app ever, a `Pokedex`! We will use React/Redux/Rails to manage <kbd>Pokemon</kbd> and their <kbd>Items</kbd> in the Pokedex. For a live demo, click on the link [here](http://aa-pokedex.herokuapp.com/#/pokemon/1)!

&nbsp;

### **Phase 0: Rails API Setup**

So, most of the work is already done for us, with a Rails backend, migrations, and models already being set up.
  * Download the [skeleton](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/swe-online/react/pokedex--part-1-). 
  * Add gem `'bootsnap'` to your Gemfile.
  * Make sure Postgres is runing, then run <kbd>rails db:setup</kbd> (short for <kbd>rails db:create db:schema:load db:seed</kbd>).

&nbsp;

Get familiar with the files and folders.
  * Take a look at the <kbd>schema</kbd>, <kbd>routes</kbd>, and <kbd>StaticPagesController</kbd>.
  * Also look at the <kbd>Pokemon</kbd> and <kbd>Item</kbd> models.
  * Open up the rails console (<kbd>rails c</kbd>) to see what is in the database.
  * Start up the rails server (<kbd>rails s</kbd>) and visit the root url. 

&nbsp;

### **API Namespace**

Let us build pokemon routes! These need to be nested under an <kbd>api</kbd> namespace.

Code:
![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Rails_API/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;1.jpg "Routes Example")

&nbsp;

The <kbd>defaults: { format: :json }</kbd> option tells the controller to first look for a <kbd>.json.jbuilder</kbd> view rather than an <kbd>html.erb</kbd> view.

Make sure the <kbd>routes.rb</kbd> table looks like the following:

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Rails_API/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;2.jpg "Rails Routes Example")

&nbsp;

### **Pokemon Controller** 

We want a controller to handle our pokemon <kbd>resources</kbd>, so it is time to build one.
  * Generate an <kbd>Api::PokemonController</kbd>.
    * Use the command <kbd>rails g controller Api::Pokemon</kbd> in order to generate the correct helper and view files.
  * Define <kbd>#index</kbd> and <kbd>#show</kbd> controller actions.

&nbsp;

It is important that our actions **render json responses**. In order for everything to flow on the front end, let us go and format our <kbd>index</kbd> action to generate json responses that look something like this:

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Rails_API/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;3.jpg "JSON Response Example")

&nbsp;

Our `primary keys` of the pokemon, **are the keys in our json response**. The objects themselves are the values. This is a perfect place to use <kbd>Jbuilder</kbd>. 
  * Create a `views/api/pokemon/index.json.jbuilder` file.
  * Iterate over each pokemon.
  * Use <kbd>json.set!</kbd> to explicitly set the key to the pokemon's id.
  * Use <kbd>json.extract!</kbd> to grab the pokemon's <kbd>id</kbd>, <kbd>name</kbd>, <kbd>image_url</kbd>.

&nbsp;

Code:
![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Rails_API/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;4.jpg "Pokemon Index JSON Example")

&nbsp;

We want to use the <kbd>asset_path</kbd> helper to find the path that is correct for the image. Locations of assets are sometimes different for production, so to make sure, use <kbd>asset_path</kbd> rather than a literal path. For more information check [these guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) out!

We have all the information we need for our index route. Keep in mind, Jbuilder allows us to `select and organize` or *curate* our data, gettting back only the attributes we want.
  * Now that we have the basics, let us create a Jbuilder view for <kbd>PokemonController#show</kbd>. We want the action to render all the pokemon info for just that pokemon, including all it's items. For this particular case, list the poke and items separately bc they represent separate resources. On Day 2 when we `normalize` our data, it will make more sense. 

&nbsp;

Remember, we want to use `json.association` to use our associtions and <kbd>@instance.association.each do |item|</kbd> in order to iterate over the associations. Everything else is just pretty much the same as our `index.json.jbuilder` file.

Code:
![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Rails_API/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;5.jpg "Pokemon Show JSON Example")

&nbsp;

A `GET` request to <kbd>localhost:3000/api/pokemon/5</kbd> should render for you:

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Rails_API/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;6.jpg "JSON Object For Pokemon Example")

&nbsp;

# **Phase 1: Frontend Setup**

&nbsp;

### **Node Package Manager**

As you have done many times before, set up a <kbd>package.json</kbd> and a <kbd>webpack.config.js</kbd> file to configure our <kbd>Pokedex</kbd> app to use <kbd>NPM</kbd> and <kbd>Webpack</kbd>.
  * Run <kbd>npm init -y</kbd> to initialize our app's <kbd>package.json</kbd> with the default boilerplate settings.
  * <kbd>npm install --save</kbd> the following packages:
    * <kbd>webpack</kbd>
    * <kbd>webpack-cli</kbd>
    * <kbd>react</kbd>
    * <kbd>react-dom</kbd>
    * <kbd>react-router-dom</kbd>
    * <kbd>redux</kbd>
    * <kbd>react-redux</kbd>
    * <kbd>redux-logger</kbd>
    * <kbd>@babel/core</kbd>
    * <kbd>@babel/preset-env</kbd>
    * <kbd>@babel/preset-react</kbd>
    * <kbd>babel-loader</kbd>
  * Add a <kbd>"webpack"</kbd> script to our <kbd>package.json</kbd> that runs <kbd>webpack --mode=development --watch</kbd>

&nbsp;

### **Webpack**

Next we need to configure Webpack to compile our <kbd>bundle.js</kbd> file.
  * Create a new file called <kbd>webpack.config.js</kbd> in the root of your project.
  * Copy and paste the following configuration:

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_1/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;1.jpg "Webpack Example")

&nbsp;

### Aside ðŸ”¥ How does Rails get <kbd>bundle.js</kbd>?

Take a look in `app/assets/application.js`. You will see a few <kbd>require</kbd> statements, known as <kbd>sprockets</kbd>.

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_1/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;2.jpg "Sprockets Example")

It may appear that these lines are commented out. However, they are actually integrating the content of these files/libraries into our <kbd>application.js</kbd> file. They are integrated in the order in which they appear. In the case above, we are requiring <kbd>jquery</kbd>, then <kbd>jquery_ujs</kbd> (adds our `CSRF token` to each <kbd>$.ajax</kbd> call with <kbd>jquery</kbd> added as a dependency) libraries before including our own local files. 

<kbd>require_tree .</kbd> includes all the files in the same directory (hence the <kbd>.</kbd> of relativity), which will include our <kbd>bundle.js</kbd> file once it has been webpacked. If including local files in a certain order is required for your app, you will need to <kbd>require</kbd> them individually as <kbd>require_tree</kbd> does not guarantee the ordering. 

Notice that in <kbd>webpack.config.js</kbd> the <kbd>entry</kbd> key is expected to point to `./frontend/pokedex.jsx`.
  * Create a <kbd>frontend</kbd> directory in the root folder of your project.
  * Add an entry file called <kbd>pokedex.jsx</kbd>.
  * <kbd>import</kbd> both the <kbd>react</kbd> and <kbd>react-dom</kbd> packages.
  * Add an event listener for <kbd>DOMContentLoaded</kbd>.
  * In the callback to this listener, try rendering a simple stateless React component to test everything we have written so far.
  * Remember to run <kbd>npm run webpack</kbd> go generate our <kbd>bundle.js</kbd>.

&nbsp;

This is what our entry file might look like:
![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_1/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;3.jpg "Pokedex Entry Example")

Browser:
![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_1/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;4.jpg "Pokedex Entry Browswer Example")


**Test our frontend setup**: Make sure our component is rendering the message we put in our h1.

&nbsp;

### **Frontend Structure**

Now it is time to flesh out the other folders in our frontend directory. Go ahead and nest <kbd>actions</kbd>, <kbd>components</kbd>, <kbd>reducers</kbd>, <kbd>store</kbd>, <kbd>middleware</kbd>, and <kbd>util</kbd> within <kbd>frontend</kbd>.

&nbsp;

# **Phase 2: <kbd>Pokemon</kbd> Redux Cycle**

&nbsp;

### **Designing the State Shape**

So, like we did with `giphy_search` homework, let us now talk once again about the shape of our application state. **This is the MOST important step**. Do not ever think about skipping it. To get going, we want to just render all of our pokemon. In order to prepare for our fullstack projects, we will be normalizing our state. Right now though, we do not have much, so having an <kbd>entities</kbd> slice of state is a good place to start.

It will have separate `sub-slices` for each of our resources (just <kbd>pokemon</kbd> for now). This will hold *all* the pokemon, for both the index item and detail views. 

**Hint:** To nest reducers inside of other reducers, use <kbd>combineReducers</kbd> inside of the <kbd>entities</kbd> reducer.

Sample State Shape:

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_2/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;1.jpg "Sample Entities State Example")

&nbsp;

An object is recommended, to store collections of objects in an app's state. It might create a few more obstacles when it comes to iterating over the collection we want to render. Still the same, an object will be way more advantagous for `updating` or `deleting` individual pokemon in our collection. (time complexity between array methods and objects). Also, keep in mind that the current state looks very similar to the json response we already created for the <kbd>PokemonController#index</kbd> action. 

&nbsp;

### **API Util and Action Creators**

Let us render all of our pokemon. To do this, let us set up a way to fetch them from the back end.
  * Create an `api_util.js` file inside our `frontend/util` folder.
    * Inside this file, we will define functions that make ajax requests fetching information from our rails api. 

  * Export a function called <kbd>fetchAllPokemon</kbd> that returns a promise.
    * The function should make an AJAX request that will make a http request to our <kbd>PokemonController#index</kbd> endpoint. 
    * Run <kbd>rails routes</kbd> to determine the appropriate url for this request. 

Code:
![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_2/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;2.jpg "ApiUtil fetchAllPokemon Example")

&nbsp;

Then, define a `Regular Action Creator` to be called on success of <kbd>ApiUtil#fetchAllPokemon</kbd>.
  * Create a `pokemon_actions.js` file within our `frontend/actions` folder.
  * Export a constant called <kbd>RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON</kbd> with the value <kbd>"RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON"</kbd>.
  * Export a function called <kbd>receiveAllPokemon(pokemon)</kbd> that returns an action object `POJO`. 
    * This action object should have two keys: <kbd>type</kbd> of <kbd>RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON</kbd> and another for the received <kbd>pokemon</kbd> data. 

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_2/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;3.jpg "Constant And Regular Action Creator Example")

&nbsp;

**Make sure the pokemon action creator and api util work in the browse before going to the next section!**
  * Import the <kdb>action</kdb> and <kbd>api_util</kbd> functions into your entry file.
  * Assign them to the <kbd>window</kbd> to test that in the browser's console.
  * You should be able to run:

&nbsp;

### **pokemonReducer**

Now it is time to make our <kbd>pokemonReducer</kbd>. Let us recap, that the `reducer` is centrally focused on the the state changes as a result of <kbd>dispatched</kbd> actions. Each reducer takes two parameters: the previous <kbd>state</kbd> and the <kbd>action</kbd> dispatched. It will always return a new object/array state or the old **existing** state. It will NEVER mutate the previous state. When the reducer does not care about a dispatched action, it just returns the `old previous state`.
  * Create a `frontend/reducers/pokemon_reducer.js` file.
  * Import our <kbd>RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON</kbd> constant.

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_2/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;7.jpg "Import Constant Example")

  * Define and <kbd>export default</kbd> a <kbd>pokemonReducer</kbd> that has a default state of an empty object.
  * Add a <kbd>switch(action.type)</kbd> statement.
  * Create <kbd>RECEIVE_ALL_POKEMON</kbd> and default cases. Remember not to mutate <kbd>state</kbd>!

&nbsp;

Code:
![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_2/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;8.jpg "Pokemon Reducer Example")

&nbsp;

### **entitiesReducer**

We want to separate our app's data and presentational states. To do this we can create nested reducers, such that eventually our redux state might look something like this: 

Note how we are using <kbd>entitites.pokemon</kbd> in order to manage *all* of the pokemon. At this point we have loaded the index, loaded the detail of Ivysaur, which is why we see Ivysaur's attack, defense, item_ids, etc., and we have also loaded Ivysaur's items in the <kbd>items</kbd> slice too. 

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_2/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;9.jpg "Entities Slice Of State Example")

&nbsp;

Create a new reducer, <kbd>entitiesReducer</kbd>, that will be in charge of combining each of our entity sub-reducers(<kbd>pokemonReducer</kbd> and later <kbd>itemsReducer</kbd>).
  * Create a new file: `/frontend/reducers/entities_reducer.js`
  * Import <kbd>combineReducers</kbd> from <kbd>redux</kbd> and our <kbd>pokemonReducer</kbd>.
  * Call <kbd>combineReducers</kbd> so that our <kbd>pokemonReducer</kbd> is responsible for the <kbd>pokemon</kbd> slice. Like so:

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_2/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;10.jpg "Entities Reducer Example")

&nbsp;

### **The rootReducer**

In order to use our <kbd>entities</kbd> reducer that we just created, we need a <kbd>rootReducer</kbd>. Again we will use <kbd>combineReducers</kbd> and create a key similarly to what we did **inside** the entities reducer. This is how we will generate our overall `application state` and how we will assign each <kbd>slice</kbd> of the state to a different reducer. Overall all this will make our app scalable, thus allowing us to grow our application state with ease.
  * Create a new file: `/frontend/reducers/root_reducer.js`.
  * Import <kbd>combineReducers</kbd> from <kbd>redux</kbd> and our <kbd>entitiesReducer</kbd>.
  * Call <kbd>combineReducers</kbd> so that our <kbd>entitiesReducer</kbd> is responsible for the <kbd>entities</kbd> slice of the application state.

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_2/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;11.jpg "RootReducer Example")

&nbsp;

### **Store**

We have come far, now it is time to test our app's reducer using a `Redux` store to dispatch from. Let us create our application store now.
  * Create a `store.js` file within the `frontend/store` folder.
  * Import <kbd>createStore</kbd> and <kbd>applyMiddleware</kbd> from the <kbd>redux</kbd> package.
  * Import our <kbd>rootReducer</kbd>.
  * Import <kbd>logger</kbd> the default export of <kbd>redux-logger</kbd> middleware. 

&nbsp;

Redux has a <kbd>createStore</kbd> function that has the following parameters: <kbd>reducer</kbd> `(rootReducer)`, an optional <kbd>preloadedState</kbd>, and any <kbd>enhancers</kbd> like `middleware`.
  * For now, call <kbd>createStore</kbd> and pass it our imported <kbd>rootReducer</kbd>, then <kbd>logger</kbd> as our only `middleware`. Keep in mind, middlewares have to be wrapped in a call to <kbd>applyMiddleware</kbd> when they are passed to <kbd>createStore</kbd>. This will be explained in more detail later.
  * Wrap the creation of the store in a <kbd>configureStore</kbd> function.

![alt text](./app/assets/images/notes/Phase_2/Screen&#32;Shot&#32;2020-02-09&#32;at&#32;12.jpg "ConfigureStore Example")

&nbsp;

### **Aside: ðŸ”¥ <kbd>configureStore</kbd> Pattern**

This is the pattern we want to practice! Instead of just exporting the store, we want to export a `function` that creates and returns a <kbd>store</kbd>. This can be used in the future to swap out reducers, <kbd>preloadedState</kbd>, or enhancers depending of different conditions (e.g. development vs productive environments).
  * In your <kbd>pokedex.jsx</kbd> entry file, import your <kbd>configureStore</kbd> function.
  * Inside the <kbd>DOMContentLoaded</kbd> callback, declare a <kbd>store</kbd>.
  * Call <kbd>configureStore</kbd> and assign its return value to <kbd>store</kbd>. 
  * For **testing purposes only**, make <kbd>getState</kbd> and <kbd>dispatch</kbd> available on the <kbd>window</kbd> (i.e. <kbd>window.getState = store.getState;</kbd> and <kbd>window.dispatch = store.dispatch</kbd>).
    * We want to avoid placing our entire <kbd>store</kbd> on the window as it can create scoping issues and create some bad bugs. 

**Test your store and reducer**. We want to be able to run the following code snippet in the browser's console:

&nbsp;

### **Thunk Middleware**

Create a new file `frontend/middleware/thunk.js` and export our <kbd>thunk</kbd> middleware. It will check the <kbd>typeof</kbd> incoming actions and either return => <kbd>action(dispatch)</kbd> **if they are functions**, or <kbd>next(action)</kbd> if they are not. Look at yesterdays [solutions](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/swe-online/react/todos--part-2-), if you need more guidence!
  * Refactor you <kbd>configureStore</kbd> function to incorporate your <kbd>thunk</kbd> middleware.
