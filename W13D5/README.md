React W13D5 Outline

- Intro to Jbuilder
    - What are the side effects of using `render json: @users`?
    - What are two reasons we want to use jbuilder over `render json:`?
        - Filter data we send up
        - Add more to the data we send up
    - Where do we put our json.jbuilder files?
    - What are some jbuilder methods we can use and how do they change our json response?
    - How do we make our routes that return json default to returning json instead of html?
- Jbuilder Documentation
    - Take a look at this and compare how the json.jbuilder methods convert the data into json objects
- Normalizing State Shape
    - Why do we want to normalize the data?
        - Data can be easily duplicated if we donâ€™t normalize it, making it harder to update the data across all instances. If we normalize the data, then we never have any repeat data.
        - Nested data means that the reducer logic has to be more complex and updating deeply nested data can be hard. Normalizing the data removes this issue
        - If one thing in a parent of deeply nested data is updated, then any information watching for changes in those nested data could re-render unnecessarily, causing many unnecessary re-renders. Normalizing the data makes re-render caused by change in data minimal
- Updating Normalized Data
    - See Slice Reducer Composition Section Only
        - action has a type
        - Add commentId to the comments array (in addComment function) in the posts reducers (through the  postsById function)
        - Add actual comment information (addCommentEntry function) in the comment reducer (through commentsById function)

Need to make sure this still works. Double checking that this works : D
