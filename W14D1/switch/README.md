# **< Switch >**

Even if, several <kbd>< Route ></kbd>'s match the current URL, `React Routers` <kbd>< Switch ></kbd> component allows us to rende ronly one. These <kbd>Route</kbd>s can be nested as many times as our heart desires, inside the opening and closing <kbd>Switch</kbd> tags. Only the **first one that matches** the current URL will be rendered. 

This becomes especially useful, when we want to have a default component to render when no other component has routes that match. This is further explained below:
