# **< Redirect >**

The <kbd>< Redirect ></kbd> component from React Router takes only one prop: <kbd>to</kbd>. When it renders, it replaces the current URL with the value of its <kbd>to</kbd> prop. Typically it is used in a conditional `statement` in order to <kbd>< Redirect ></kbd> a user away from a page that we do not want them to visit. An example might be, we want a user to be redirected to the login page when they are not logged in.
