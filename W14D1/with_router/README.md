# **withRouter**

Sometimes a component has not been rendered yet by a <kbd>Route</kbd> component, but we want access to the current routing information. This is where <kbd>withRouter</kbd> comes in to save the day! Like <kbd>connect</kbd> from <kbd>react-redux</kbd>, <kbd>withRouter</kbd> is a higher order component that wraps a react component and passes it the router props <kbd>location</kbd>, <kbd>match</kbd>, and <kbd>history</kbd> (look at [this reading](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/swe-online/react/intro-to-react-router) for a refresher).
