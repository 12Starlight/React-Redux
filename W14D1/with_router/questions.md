# **withRouter Questions**

What is the purpose of withRouter?
>Answer: It gives us the ability to give a component the props that a Route componenet would pass down to its child. We do not need to wrap a component with Route, if all we want is the <kbd>props</kbd> that a Route component gives. Instead we can use <kbd>withRouter</kbd>.
