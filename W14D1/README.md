    - What is the Route component and what is the purpose of it?
        - What are the possible props of the Route component and what do they do?
            - component (don't need this if you have render)

            - exact
            - render (don't need this if you have component)
    - Frontend routing and Wildcards
        - How do we indicate wildcards in the path of Route component?
    - What is the purpose of all the props that the direct child of a Route component has access to:
        - location
        - match
            - isExact
            - url

- <Switch> Reading
    - What is the purpose of a Switch component?

- withRouter Reading
    - What is the purpose of withRouter?
        - withRouter gives us the ability to give a component the props that a Route component would pass down to its child
        - We don't need to wrap a component with Route if all we want is the props that a Route component gives. Instead we can use withRouter

    - How is the NavLink being used and for what purpose?
    - How is the Route component being used and for what purpose?
- Route Wildcard Props Video

- Container Component ownProps & Wildcard Routes Video
    - What is ownProps? How do we get things into ownProps?
    - Why do we pass in information through a wildcard in our Route component instead of passing the information as props directly?
    - How did Tommy make sure to pass in the author information along with the bleat? Why did he use Object.assign?
    - Why did bleat come in as undefined when Tommy refreshed the screen at /bleats/1? How did he fix that?
