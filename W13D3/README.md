- Store Reading:
	- What does the store do?
		- The store holds global state
		- Updates the state with its reducers
		- listens for actions that change the state
		- Allows components to listen for changes in the state
	- createStore()
		- what arguments do they take?
		- what does each argument do?
	- Store functions
		- getState() - what does it do?
		- dispatch(action) - what does it do?
		- subscribe(callback) - what does it do?
	- what does an action always have?
- Reducers Reading:
	- A reducer is a function that returns the updated state based on the action.type
	- It receives the current state and an action
	- what will be the initial current state when the store initializes?
	- if no case matches the action.type, then the reducer doesn’t care about the action and will return state unchanged
	- Reducer must return new object IF the state changes
	- how does combine reducers work?
	- what is a slice of state?
- Actions Reading:
	- What is an action creator and what does it return?
	- how do we dispatch an action?
- Provider Reading:
	- What’s the difference between having a Provider and not having a Provider wrapping your App?
	- What does Provider allow us to do?
- connect Reading:
	- What arguments does connect function take?
	- What does connect function return?
	- How do we connect our presentational component using the connect function?
	- mapStateToProps:
		- What are the arguments to mapStateToProps?
		- what is the return value?
		- Where is that return value going?
		- What is ownProps?
	- mapDispatchToProps:
		- What are the arguments to mapDispatchToProps?
		- What is the return value?
		- Where is that return value going?
- Containers reading: 
	- what is a container component?
	- what is a presentational component?
	- what are the differences between them?
- Selectors reading:
	- Selectors are functions
	- what are they used for? what are the inputs and outputs?
	- what is the purpose of a selector?
- Window API reading: 
	- what is the window?
	- if you run your JavaScript code in the browser, the global context is the window
	- how can we test using the window? (paired with the video, Testing on the Window)
- Fruit Stand Demo:
	- try the things they ask you to do in Phase II and after each one, ask yourself How did the DOM change in reaction to the thing you tried?
	- Where did you import your store and how did you give access to the store to your App?
	- see where and how they defined actions to test on the window
- Homeworks:
	- Job Listing: 
		- this project is using the methods that you created in your Redux Lite project. See where they are using those methods
		- how is the action influencing the reducer?
		- how is the action hitting the reducer?
- Todos Project Part 1: 
	- Make note of the file structure
	- Be able to see a slice of state and make actions and reducers for it
	- Be able to test your actions on the console using the window
	- Be able to make components that will display information from the store 
	- Understand what selectors do and where they go and how they are used
	- Be able to dispatch actions to the store on user input
	- Understand how to make child components with their own container components
