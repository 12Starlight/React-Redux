# Debugging Arrow Functions In React 

### **Summary**

Arrow functions are everywhere in React and Redux. Here is an example from the `actions` reading on action creators:

Looking at the <kbd>clearFunction</kbd> example in [the reading on arrow functions](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/swe-online/react/es6-arrow-functions), parenthesis are a common way to implicity return objects using ES6. For this reason, the above will just not work. We just simply can **not** put a debugger inside of a return statement!

Instead, in order to put a debugger inside of <kbd>addFruit</kbd>, we first need to convert it into a function with an explicit return statement:

In order to have to consistantly repeat doing this, just create a habit of writing **ALL** of your arrow functions with *explicit* return statements. Keep in mind, this is a common pattern in Redux and you can expect to see it out in the world.
