#### What is React?
> Answer: React is a Javascript library for creating UI components. React's specialty is exactly what its name implies: reaction. When the data that is represented by the UI changes, React *reacts* by updating the UI. 

#### Why would we need React?
> Answer: React allows us to manage all UI updates when any piece of my app changes. When the state of the application changes, React re-renders *all* elements. Also, React provides a *simple* interface for front-end developers to use. 

#### How does it work?
> Answer: When the component is initially renderedf, the markup is generated and added to the document. When the data is changed, React renders again, but instead of replacing the component wholesale, it updates only the bit that has changed. It does this by comparing the `diff` on what is there compared to what should be there. 

#### Where does React come from?
> Answer: React comes from Facebook.
