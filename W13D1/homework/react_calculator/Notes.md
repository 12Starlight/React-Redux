# Progress


#### Parts I felt confident
> Setting up files, npm, script, webpack, index, and app.jsx<br>
> Setting up initial state and input with <kbd>onChange</kbd> and <kbd>value</kbd> <br>
> **Note: Did not look at homework solutions :D** :heart_eyes: 

#### Parts I struggled with
> Creating event handlers `setNum1` and `setNum2`
  * Had to look at props_state code snippets to get `e.currentTarget.value`
